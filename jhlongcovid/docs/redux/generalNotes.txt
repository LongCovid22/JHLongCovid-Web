Extensively utilized https://www.merixstudio.com/blog/introduction-using-redux-toolkit-nextjs-and-typescript/ tutorial
for our start in using React redux. Steps were:
- installing @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
- copying/pasting hook.ts and store.ts from tutorial (mostly boilerplate code)
- in __app.tsx, wrapped our application with <Provider store = {store}>, where store is our redux store
- created our slices in the redux folder, a slice usually needs the following: a type to represent the type of the global
object we are keepign track of, an initial state, reducers (what can change state) inside of createSlice, exporting the
reducers, exporting the variable itself, and exporting the reducer.
- added reducers to our store.

- In our view, we can use dispatch to use the reducers and appselector to use the variable.
