Redux:

- Why does reducers when defined have state as the first variable?
In Redux Toolkit, reducers defined within a slice typically follow the "reducer-first" syntax, where the first parameter is the current state and the second parameter is the action. However, when you call the reducer, you only pass the payload as the argument.

The reason for this is that Redux Toolkit uses an internal mechanism called "immer" to handle immutable updates to the state. Immer takes care of creating a new copy of the state for you, so you only need to modify the state object within the reducer.
